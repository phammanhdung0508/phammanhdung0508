# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The website showcases my profile, experience, and projects.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) installed on your machine.
